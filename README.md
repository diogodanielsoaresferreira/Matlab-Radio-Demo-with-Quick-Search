# Matlab-Radio-Demo-with-Quick-Search
Project presented during classes of Probabilities applied to Informatic Engineering (Universidade de Aveiro), using MatLab.

The application is a radio capable of playing locally stored songs. The main goal of the project was to make an appropriate use of a Bloom Filter and a minHash.

The Bloom Filter is used to make sure that the song is not already in the local playlist, without taking too much time. The minHash is used to search to search the songs by its name.

Is not permitted the distribution of the pdf files, neither their commercial use.
